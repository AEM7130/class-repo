    "## Problem 1: Integration and functional programming\n",
    "A profit-maximizing firm faces a demand curve given by: $P(q) = a-bq$ where $b\\sim logN(\\mu,\\sigma)$ and has a cost function given by $C(q) = cq$. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function called `profit_max_q(a, c, mu, sigma, method, n)` that returns the numerical optimal quantity given a set of inputs $(a, c, \\mu, \\sigma, method, n)$, where `method` is a string that takes on a value of `\"mc\"` or `\"quad\"` and determines whether you integrate using Monte Carlo or quadrature methods, and `n` is the number of Monte Carlo draws or quadrature nodes.\n",
    "2. Choose a set of values $(a, c, \\mu, \\sigma)$ and use `profit_max_q` to solve the problem for both approaches to integration. Use the `CompEcon` package to implement the quadrature routine.\n",
    "3. Make sure your code is type-stable by using the code introspection macros (e.g. `@code_llvm, @code_warntype, @trace`)"

    "Approximate $\\pi$ using Monte Carlo integration. You may only use `rand()` to generate random numbers. Here is how to think about approximating $\\pi$:\n",
    "1. Suppose $U$ is a two dimensional random variable on the unit square $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$. The probability that $U$ is in a subset $B$ of $(0,1)\\times(0,1)$ is equal to the area of $B$.\n",
    "2. If $u_1,...,u_n$ are iid draws from $U$, then as $n$ grows (by an LLN type argument), the fraction that falls inside $B$ is the probability of another iid draw coming from $B$.\n",
