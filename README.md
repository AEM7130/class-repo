## Course Objective

The objective of this course is to familiarize you with computational methods for economics. In this course you should learn why we need computational methods for certain types of problems, the theory behind the methods, and most importantly, how to use them in practice. The first part of the course covers general basics of computing and doing computational research. The second part covers optimization and function approximation. The third part covers basic dynamic theory and then goes over a selection of methods for solving dynamic models either numerically or empirically. The fourth part covers prediction and machine learning. The course concludes with how to use high performance computing resources like computing clusters. The beginning of the course is heavy on theory to understand what is happening inside your machine when solving numerical models. As we begin studying techniques to solve economic problems you will also apply them in practice.

I will be teaching the class in Julia. Julia is becoming widely used in computational economics because it's open source, it has many packages to employ the methods we will learn and practice, and it's fast and intuitive. **Please set up a GitHub (https://github.com) account before class starts.** Much of what we do can be easily ported to R, Python, MATLAB, and C.

## Readings

Some theory on dynamics will draw from Karp and Traeger (2013). Nocedal and Wright (2006) is highly useful as a detailed reference for optimization. Judd (1998) and Miranda and Fackler (2002) take a more detailed look at the fundamental numerical methods in economics. Judd (1998), Miranda and Fackler (2002), and Nocedal and Wright (2006) are available as eBooks in the library and Karp and Traeger (2013) will be available on Canvas or from the authors' websites. Please read *Learn Julia the Hard Way* or go over the first few [QuantEcon Julia lectures](https://quantecon.org) for a brief introduction to coding in Julia. The remainder of the required readings will be from journal articles or excerpts from texts which will be accessible online and posted on GitHub a week before class.

## Assignments

### Problem sets
There will be four problem sets. You must submit your code on [GitHub](https://github.com) to your group's repository. We will learn how to use Git during class and will be using GitHub Classroom for submissions. You may work in a group of **three or fewer people**. **You must submit your problem set solutions as a well-commented (and already executed) Jupyter notebook in either Julia, Python, or R.** Each group should turn in one assignment with all members' names in the first cell of the notebook. 

### Final project

There is a final project for the course, due at the end of the semester, where each student will submit the beginning of a numerically-driven research paper. A proposal of the final project is due at about the halfway point of the course. During the final week of class, each student will present their completed work which should have a first-take at a numerical/empirical model and preliminary results. The paper is due the day after the final class. It should be at least 10 pages including tables and graphs and should:

1. Have an introduction that clearly states the economic question you are answering, frames your research in the context of the existing literature, and tells the reader what you are doing to advance economic knowledge.
2. Analytically develop the model, provide proofs for theoretical results if there are any.
3. Describe how you solve the model.
4. Have preliminary results.

### Numerical paper presentations
Starting near the middle of the course, one student a week will present either a paper that either applies methods we have learned in a previous week, or extends methods we have previously learned. More information will come later in the course.
